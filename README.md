# Quiddiards
School project for Computer Graphics class. 

Combination of Quidditch and Billiards. 

Implemented in OpenGL. 


Note:

The program is developed with Qt, thus Qt .dll files are required to run release version. Yet some textures may be missing when running on some computers. Since the project was only developed for class, no future fix would be patched.
